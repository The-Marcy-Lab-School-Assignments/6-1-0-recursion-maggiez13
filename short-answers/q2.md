# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Recursion is best suited for problems that can be divided into smaller, similar sub-problems and solved individually before combining their solutions. It is ideal for recursive data structures like linked lists, graphs, and trees, and is commonly used in divide-and-conquer algorithms such as merge sort and binary search. Recursion also works well for mathematical problems like factorials and exponentiation, where the problem is defined in terms of smaller instances of itself.
