# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
A recursive function is one that calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case. In recursive functions, there are two primary components: the base case and the recursive case. The recursive case involves the function calling itself with a modified set of parameters, continuing this process until the base case is met. Once the base case is met, the function stops calling itself and begins to return results back up the chain of previous calls,"bubbling up" the results.
